# Enter the real challenge

## Objective

Your goal is to write a script that will help us to find the unused components in the codebase.

We've helped you by already creating the script file and added the shebang.


### Hints

- An component is a file that ends up with .vue extension
- You should use different variables to stock the path where to look at
- You should use a temp file to stock the results of your research
- You should use the find command
